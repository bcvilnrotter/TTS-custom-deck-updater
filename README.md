# TTS-custom-deck-updater
This is an exploratory repo that hopes to provide a solution for the following scenario. A script that can be used to pull information from a spreadsheet in the cloud (as an example, a google-sheet stored in a gdrive location) that can be used to update a custom deck in TTS on the fly. This might be an upgrade or an alternative to prototype-assist.
